1,"I went to emergency room and was treated like a horse. Dr. weller did not look at test results nor examine me , he looked at my face and said I was not sick when in reality I had a severe torn rotor cuff that was inflamed. My whole arm was swollen. He left out of the room saying noyhing was wrong with me and he was doing nothing. He left me in severe pain, and elevated  pressure, I asked his name and he sais Skovosky or something. I had to get his name from the nurse.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital

1,"I took my mom to the ER because she was having palpitations that wouldn't go away and she felt she was going to pass out. When we checked in we were told to wait for the nurse. After awhile, I asked how long it would be because she didn't look good and she has a history of PEs. The lady at the desk said "" Oh she has panic attacks?"" I said NO pulmonary embolism! We still waited another 5-10 minutes before they took her back. Someone took her vitals and did an EKG but never introduced he,rself so we are not sure if that was the nurse or not. They did not leave her on a monitor. They left her in the room for another 20 minutes or so without saying a word. She saw a doctor walking around aimlessly as if he were lost. She asked the nurse...or at least who she thought was a nurse... if that was the only doctor they had. She said yes, and very rudely said "" I have someone coming in on an ambulance, I need to see him first. I'll get to you when I can"" So my mom said, I guess yall are busy, maybe I should go somewhere else. The lady replied, again very rudely, ""Yes we are busy. I can't force you to stay so if you want to go then go"".....so we left. We are both nurses. I work in the ICU/CCU. Never again will we go back there. We thought since it was Methodist now it would be better....IT'S NOT! The hospital I work at would have immediately taken her to the back, hooked her up to a monitor, placed an IV and drew labs. Next time we will make the extra drive to go there instead",Houston Methodist St John Hospital

5,"Kind, personal, and caring people. Excellent and friendly service. Job well done--made the extra effort to work out the problem.

5,"My husband was admitted to this hospital after getting a horrible infection that caused Gangrene. The staft could not have been nicer.  We were told that the surgeon did an excellent job of getting all of the infection cleaned out.   ,,I have heard that this hospital used to not be so good but that has changed. I am not sure if they got new owners or what.  Now they send out surveys after you leave the hospital so I am sure that helps them to be on their toes.",San Jacinto Methodist Hospital
2,"Before I went to their ER for treatment, I called and made sure that this hospital is at my insurance networking- Blue Cross and Blue Shield.  When I signed up at ER room, the first thing I did (also that is only thing they want to see and what they care about) is my insurance information, and I provided them everything they need.  I waited for almost a hour and finally they sent a doctor to see me and treated me. One month later, I received an invoice from this doctor said by the way,, he is not at my insurance networking, I need paid hundreds dollars to him. ,,For another procedure I did there, they sent me 3 invoices with different balance dues for the same thing. I called them many times, they said I don't have to pay, they will contact my insurance company. Since then, they keep sending me at least 4 invoices said I owned them money.",Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
5,"I had 3 visits to this hospital.  The first time was when I got diagnosed with pneumonia.  11PM on a Saturday... expected to see every """"Tom, Dick, and Harry"""" there from a long night.  Instead, there were 2 other people there and I went back to the back within about 10 minutes.  The doctor looked at me and it was diagnosed as pneumonia.	,	,I didn't listen to the doc and waited to follow up with my PCP and ended up having to return and was admitted... spent two weeks and it was more pl,easurable than anything I could have imagined for a hospital experience (except it would have been nice to have some DirecTV... work on that TMH- you know you want it).  14 days of wonderful care.	,	,The only downer of an experience was when my wife had some issues with her asthma and they didn't have a bed for her to spend the night, so we had to get transferred up to Tomball.  	,	,I don't know what these negative reports are from, but it wasn't anywhere near the experience I had.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,"Wish I would have read these reviews before taking my son there yesterday but unfortunately when you have a """"respected hospital"""" in your back yard you expect to get above average medical care especially during an emergency. My son cut himself  pretty badly with a kitchen knife so we rushed him to the emergency room with a blood soaked towel wrapped around his hand at 1 o'clock. When we got there they took the towel off and wrapped it with an ace, without even looking at the injury. P,ut in a room and of course the obligatory ER wait even if blood is pouring out of your hand. Sorry to be long with this review but I want to make sure no one goes through what they put my son through. Wanted to do an xray but couldn't because blood was pouring our of his hand. Then they thought he cut the artery in the palm, called a hand specialist but didn't request one to come see him. They told us that he needed to be transported to Mem Hermann downtown for possible microsurgery, this without any confirmation from a hand specialist that he acutally cut the artery. At 5 fifteen an ambulance came to transfer him, this is in the middle of rush hour traffic. Arrived at  Mem Hermann at 6 thirty five and was put in the ER, remember this is one of the busiest ones in the city. We were told at Methodist that he was going to be put in a room when he got to Mem Hermann and a hand specialist was going to look at him, why that didn't happen at Methodist, I don't know.\r	,My son had to wait in that ER until 9 forty five before he was looked at by a doctor and all they did was clean the wound, irrigate it and close it with 4 stitches. He was released at 10 thirty, that's nine and a half hours to get 4 stitches to close his wound because of the incompetence of the ER staff and not doing the right thing. I found out that Mem Hermann at Memorial City had the microsurgery capabilities, 20 minutes away but of cours we were not given the option of taking him there. Pass up that ER even if you're bleeding to death, I know I will. I am pursuing further complaints against them, what happened was unacceptable to me. Too bad there isn't minus 5 star rating. Unbelievable!!!!",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,"I went with a cut on my finger that I could not get to stop bleeding.  The doctor was amiable and decided to dermabond it instead of stitching it, even if the blood was obviously pushing against the glue.  I asked if the dermabond would hold back the blood and he said yes.  In a matter of hours, the blood burst through and the dermabond did not work.  A call to the ER told said I could come back.  Really?  At no charge since you didn't fix it the first time?  No, of course not.  I neve,r had a problem with stitches and it is annoying that they did not take that route in the first place and now I have to pay again to get it done.  This place used to be good years ago, now I wouldn't go back.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
2,"I also got the feeling that most all the staff did not care about the patients or any one else on the premises for	,that matter. I saw a bunch of talking and laughing between employees while ignoring basic request of the visitors (patients and others).	,I stood at a door for 30 sec do get let in. The staff was just talking away (personal stuff - not job related) , and one of them was actually facing me. This level of treatment went on for the entire two day stay in the hospital. They j,ust don't seem to understand the customer appreciation. Someone needs to tell them that the customers pay their bills. I just shake my head.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,"I have frequent lab work and although all my doctors are at Methodist Medical Center the Willowbrook location is more convenient for lab work.  This morning registration could not find my faxed orders, after looking for less than a minute, I was told to take a seat and she would look for them, obviously when she finished with the line behind me.  I prepay everything because I do not have insurance.  The usual is having to wait again while they decide what to charge me and the cost is a,lways different for the same tests.  A few months ago my doctor called to tell me they ran all the wrong tests, I had to return to Willowbrook and although it was their mistake I had to pay again or they wouldn't run the tests.  I have to find another place to have blood drawn, this place is ridiculous.  Methodist Willowbrook gets an F- while Methodist Medical Center gets an A+.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,"i was taken by ambulance to Methodist Willowbrook because they would take me only to the nearest hospital.  My leg was swollen and cherry pink.  The eventual diagnosis was cellulitis--a skin infection that can throw embolisms and cause fatal sepsis.  Almost all of the experience was a harrowing experience.  Examples:,--I suffer severe chronic pain treated by a path medication.  The doctors didn't want me to use it.  They promised me that equivalent pain relief would be provided.  In t,he ER it was supplied once.  In a hospital room I waited up to 1.5 hours for medication that was--at the most--barely adequate and--all too often--didn't take the edge off the pain.,--I was to receive a spinal tap.  it took over 6 hours before the procedure was done. It was was so painful I was screaming.  The folks administering the test were baffled why I had not been brought much earlier.  They'd been expecting me for hours.,--The hospital treated my diabetes using a protocol that's been out of date for at least a dozen years.  Using  my up to date protocol my blood sugar levels are like a person without  diabetes.  Prior to that my levels had been significantly above ADA accepted levels.,--At admission I provided a printout of the medications I take, the dosage and when it was to be taken.  In the 5 days in the hospital, the hospital never provided me all of the medications my doctors have prescribed for me.  I offered to use my own from home under their direction--offer refused.,--Medications were added that conflicted with medications I take.,--I was asked to provide a medication I always take.  It wasn't returned to me at time of discharge.,--A head administrative nurse--after one of the disasters--said she would check up on me every half hour.  I never saw her again.,--Communication was poor even for their own staff.  A doctor scheduled a procedure I was leery of and wanted to consult my primary care doctor. Years ago I'd undergone this procedure.  It took months for me to recover from the pain it caused--I was leery of doing it again. I told nursing staff the night prior I wouldn't be signing off on the procedure.  The doctor wasn't notified and came storming into my room asking me where I'd been.  He'd been waiting for me.  I'd expressed to him my hesitation when he'd told me his plan.  He wanted to do angio exploration of one part of my body.  A second doctor wanted to do the same exploration--but of another part of my body.  The first doctor rather haughtily refused do share a procedure with another doctor, while the second doctor understood my concern and was open to a joint venture.,,I will have to salute a social worker and 2 Rn's.,I believe the floor staff were drastically understaffed.,,,This is only a sample of the poor treatment I received.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,"My husband took my mother-in-law to this hospital for pain in her lower abdomen.  She was running a fever and throwing up in the emergency room.  The hopsital did take her INSURANCE information so they could get paid and her temp and blood pressure and told her to wait.  She was in extreme pain and wanted to lay down as she was hurting all over.  The staff seemed unconcerned and told her that there was no beds available.  She continued to sit there for over 3 hours in so much pain and ,no one ever came to look at the area that was hurting.  The staff was talking about buying concert tickets and on their cell phones in the ER while the ER phone was ringing.  My husband told the staff that the pain had moved up to her chest, and still nothing was done.  My mother-in-law could not longer sit because the pain was going up her back and went home without being seen by a doctor.  The next morning she was in so much pain she could not walk, and she had spot on her lower stomach that had turned BLACK and was spreading down her lower regions of her body.  Her fever was 101.6 and she did not look well at all.  She called her doctor and he told her to go to the nearest ER and have SURGERY right away.  My husband took her to North Cypress and they got her right in.  She had an abcess that looked like a brown recluse spider bite and after surgery they Dr. said he took out 3 softball size pieces of tissue from her abdomen.  He said the infection had spread all the way to her muscle!!!  He said had she waited any longer that things could have been severly worse.  I cannot imagine what would of happened if we would of just WAITED on Methodist to look at her.  Please do not take your family to this hospital.  They are incompetent and have no compassion at all.  I will be making a complaint to whom ever and where ever I can so this does not happen to anyones else.  We were all scared for her and had Methodist actually LOOKED at her they would have seen what was wrong and she could have taken care of the pain sooner.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,"I took a loved one to the ER at Methodist Willowbrook twice (due to the vicinity and the Methodist name).\r	,\r	,TAKE HEED:  This is NOT the same Methodist Hospital (quality, courteousness, attentiveness, and competency) that you get in the Texas Medical Center.  From the clerk that checks you into the ER to the nurses in triage...a lack of compassion for the patient despite the patient's expressed physical pain and worries.  The triage staff is very unsympathetic and seem to not enjoy, their work.\r	,\r	,I would have been able to let all of that go, except for the fact that I have just left the Methodist Hospital in the Texas Medical Center this morning realizing that the Willowbrook Methodist dismissively misdiagnosed a life threatening condition yesterday.  \r	,\r	,The Willowbrook Methodist sent my loved one home yesterday with a prescription for an antibiotic and told her she simply had """"a bug"""".  They did this, despite my loved one's suggestion to the attending doctor that it could be something more severe due to the unusual and acute pain she suffered from.  The doctor at Willowbrook Methodist ruled out anything more serious in a very dismissive manner.  \r	,\r	,Fortunately, my loved one knew others in the medical field whom she consulted with after leaving Methodist Willowbrook because she continued to experience the unusual and excruciating pain.   \r	,\r	,Hours later after she could bear her pain no longer and at the strong urging of her medical friends, she made the decision to get a second examination at the Texas Medical Center's Methodist Hospital.  After a much kinder (and quicker) ER registration, gracious and attentive evaluations from caring nurses (and interns), my loved one was diagnosed with a ruptured appendix.  \r	,\r	,Yesterday, had Methodist Willowbrook actually listened to her and took the effort to properly examine her, she would not have suffered as terribly as she did.   They allowed her to go home thinking that she had a normal infection when she had a condition that she could have died from if left untreated!  \r	,\r	,From here on, I will take the longer drive to the Texas Medical Center...I am now very suspicious of these outer lying, """"Mc Methodist Hospitals"""" in the suburbs.  Unfortunately, it appears that from the top down, they significantly fail to meet  the excellent  standards I had come to expect and trust from the Methodist name.\r	,\r	,I have a  strong feeling that the staff at this Willowbrook Methodist location simply arrive each day to receive their paychecks, whereas their amazing counterparts at Methodist in the Texas Medical Center appear to be sharp, passionate about their work, and respectful to every human being that checks into their hospital.  \r	,\r	,Again, I hope my experience can make the difference for someone else.  My loved one did not die from the misdiagnosis, though she suffered unnecessarily and tremendously from the pain of an undiagnosed ruptured appendix.  In fact, I am packing some of her personal belongings now and getting ready to visit her since she is now post-op.  The """"real"""" Methodist successfully operated on her early this morning.  \r	,\r	,I do not want something much worse to occur to someone else in the future.  \r	,\r	,And, if there are others out there with similar stories, write letters to the medical board, the attorney general, and, if, in your case, there was an injury or suffering due to the lack of proper care, explore your legal options.  Doctors, nurses, and any hospital staff are there to serve you--the profession is supposed to be """"a calling"""".   It appears that the staff at Methodist Willowbrook have forgotten this and instead treat you as if you were their burden.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1,I was called by Rosa from the billing office and was told due to an outstanding balance they will not allow my medically necessary surgery to take place.  She said I will have to pay $2000 upfront before my surgery can take place.  She refused to set me up on a payment plan.  We are in a flippin recession and people can barely buy groceries let alone drop $2k for something out of their control.

1,"My Emergency Room experience was terrible! I  came in for 3pm and waited in the waiting room until 5:30pm when an assistant person FINALLY came out and said sorry for the wait but we don't have any rooms available. My emergency was urgent as well as the others waiting before me and we were all put on hold for a kid who had scraped her knee and just needed band aids. The screening process is terrible. When I finally got to a room I waited another hour to see someone while the nurses all, laughed, joked, and played around at the nurses station, one nurse even walked around introducing her mom to the staff. After I finally got done and time to discharge (time now 7:45) the money collected guy comes in and forces/bullies me to not only pay the $100 co-pay but a 1,000 dollar bill as well that after paying explains that I could have just paid the 100.  By this time I'm so angry and fed up with Methodist Sugar Land I left furious and thought ""no wonder people show up to hospitals and go crazy on the staff"" they don't care about the patients AT ALL.

1,"I could not believe how bad the whole experience was. ,,I made the appointment online. Then as instructed faxed the order and insurance information to the fax number given to me. I called to make sure the fax was received. I was told everything was received and in order. , I called back 2 additional times last week  to verify that there was nothing else needed. , I got a call the day before the mri from the hospital to verify the appointment. At that time I was told again that ever,ything was in order and they wanted me to pay in advance. It sounded strange to pay first, but I said I would. Looking at my Cigna site for mri cost the pricing was 375.00 to 460.00 at the highest place. I was told the cost to me after insurance was $885.00. Completely over the top, but since I needed the procedure I agreed and paid., This is when everything got really bad. I show up 45 minutes early as asked. There is no one there, just a sign saying they will be back. I wait 20 minutes to have someone come out and tell me I have to go up front and check in first. I go to the front of the hospital and there is no one at the main booth or any of the check in desks. After waiting over ten minutes with other people that are waiting to be helped I go back to the mri center and ask if she would please page someone to come help me., I finally find someone return to her desk., She tells me that they cannot perform my mri because the referring doctor is ""not on her list"".,,I asked why that when during the several phone calls and confirming that everything was in order that no one told me there was any problems., I can't believe I was even asked to pay in advance for something they were never planning to do anyway. I asked for a refund of the money I spent. I was told they could not give me my money back until I call the billing department Monday. ,,With no other options I logged in to my Cinga site and called another place on the list and got right in within an hour. As a note they couldn't figure why you were so expensive, when they only charged me $400 for the MRI. ,, I felt treated as number, not person. I was shocked how disorganized the hospital was and badly I was treated.",Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital

I talked to so many people there including the billing, and everytime, I was told, they see that I did not stay there the night, they will correct the mistake, however they, never did.,I also talked to administrative manager at Sugarland, she looked at the papaerwork I showed and said it is definately their mistake and she will correct it and sorry for the mistake. ,After a few weeks when I followed up she changed her story completely and said the billing was right and no change will be done.,What a bunch of liars and crooks...

I contacted insurance and the,y clarified that they have to sent because they have sent wrong codes which I was not diagnosed. The treatment is also pathetic... NO results so far and I end up calling insurance and medical deparmtners form the past 2 months and no results yet..

The meds should have been brought from home and available, especially if she's diabetic... why didn't the daughter give the meds??? Was she told not to gve her the meds??? It seems she's still in ER and that is not the admitting unit, so why wait two hours for the ""mom"" to get her meds if she already has meds from home??? Did it look like there were no other emergencies,, like cardiac arrests, shock, traumas??? ER nurses don't usually get a chance to sit very long and the system has to work for all, primarily emergencies that cannot be delayed (again, codes, shock, trauma, strokes), but I only see one focus, ""the Mom"" , nothing else about what is happening and why the delays.  Some folks have had to wait 2 days in ER because of ""no rooms"" available, etc. Too much info left out to warrant a justified complaint about the hospital.

I hate to say this but everything you will read about her and the care you will get is true. After me getting checked in by a very good nurse, in came the all too talked about female pca from hell!!! I was given a blue bag to throw up in and after being given some medication for nausea, about 45 minutes later I went to the bathroom while in there threw up again with to,tal red blood. I asked for something more to help with nausea and horrid pain. My RN went to ask for something, she said tell her I will be right in. After 15 minutes the RN asked if she had came in, and I said no, he went to find her. In about 15 minutes she walked in and said I really see no reason to admit you or do anything for you, after all you have not thrown up again since you first got here. I said I just threw up again when I went to the bathroom a bit ago. She said oh well, I think you look good enough to be home, I don't see any reason to admit you here. I have terminal cancer. I had just came from the Dr's office where he had written some prescription's. On one it even said on it the I-9 code and terminal stomach cancer. When asked what medication's I was on at home, I showed her the actual prescription's my Dr. had just wrote for earlier, where she could even read what I have written by the Dr. on one of them, yet she couldn't see any reason to admit me????!!!??? I was discharged in 10 minutes while still actively throwing up blood with terminal cancer. This woman should not be allowed to even practice medicine, much less over see an emergency room (No Dr. came in to see me at all, with me being a terminal cancer patient). DON""T go and allow that woman to treat you or you're loved one!!! I am home throwing up blood and so sick I have not been able to even get up and enjoy my Holiday, when I should be in a Hospital seeing if I need yet ANOTHER blood transfusion, I've had 5 due to this type of Cancer. Yet an assistant to a Dr. not even a Dr. after being told I was still throwing up blood discharged, and falsified medical record's by saying I had not thrown up again since given the nausea medication, when I had. Simply wrote I was there due to nausea....not throwing up blood, nothing about me having cancer..... I will be contacting Administration tomorrow when they are open again, and tell them the real shame here is how many bad reports can be read and MOST are due to this PCA....",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1,"Don't go! People were rude! I went for an MRI and was told three days prior that if I owed money they would call back. After waiting an hour and them telling me that they did not have my insurance info,they tell me I owe $2,000. I told them I would pay $600. After going back and forth with manager they told me to pay $1,000 and I said I can pay $600. The manager said, ""WEll Then you can leave"". I left  and called my insurance to explain the situation and they told me to go to, Katy imaging because they only charge $425.

1,"I clearly had the same PA (physician's assistant) that MadViking had. Went to the ER with what I suspected was another kidney stone (have passed more than 20), vomiting, etc. Got to the room fairly quickly, waited for about 15 minutes and was greeted by a very nice male nurse. Asked what was going on, I explained, he himself even said that stones are one of the most painful things the human can experience, was extremely empathetic, then said he was going to get me fixed up with somethi,ng to help my pain and would be right back. ,,About 15 minutes later walks in a younger female stating that she's the PA, and also asked what was going on. I again explained what had been going on for at this point several hours - excruciating pain, vomiting, etc. She tells me she's goi g to give me something to help the pain, as well as fluids (which I desperately wanted as it always helps the stone pass), and asks if I've ever had a specific NSAID they often give for stones. I told her yes, I've had it. Problem is that I'd taken two of that medication at home prior to coming, as well as an old Vicodin that I had leftover from a previous episode, none of which helped me. The nurse walks in a few minutes later and asked when exactly I'd had it, I tell him and he leaves. ,,He returned about 10 minutes later with a pill. A PILL. I'd been vomiting for hours, and they expect me to hold a pill down? I ask what it is and he tells me - it was essentially glorified Tylenol (that I already had at home). He also gave me a glass of water. ,,No fluids (as she previously stated), nothing for the nausea, nothing to truly help my pain. I had already had blood and urine taken, no results yet. At one point when the PA first came in, she starts telling me that my urine was fine - but then says ""oh wait, that's someone else - I haven't looked at yours"". Completely incompetent. ,,I felt as though I was treated like a lowly and a drug head. Absolutely disgusted! I've had MANY kidney stones unfortunately, and know the standard course of treatment that is usually followed for them - NONE of which I received (fluids, nausea and pain meds via IV). I will absolutely never return to this facility after it being indirectly implied that I was some sort of dope fiend. Even my 18 year old son who was with me said ""what the ___?!"" As he's been withe before during a stone episode. Patient beware!",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1,"For heavens sake, don't take anyone to the emergency room.  I took my wife there after she fell, hurting her hip and back. We never saw a doctor, only a PA.  She was snotty and treated my wife like she was an addict trying to get drugs.  I couldn't believe it. My wife had such pain in her back and legs she couldn't urinate. The PA shouldn't be allowed to deal with patients and her supervisory doctor needs to receive a letter in his file for not doing his job.  This place really is bad!",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1,"please look for another hospital especially the icu. There will be one physician in charge of that place who rarely talks with the family , or asks the family of their opinions. Patient's choice is non existent in this hospital.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1,"Find another hospital. This was my second surgery there and the first time was an outpatient procedure which I did not have any problems. If staying overnight the nursing staff is horrible. They do not keep track of the doctors orders much less follow them. They do not manage your pain and seem to care less if you are in pain. One went to lunch and failed to notify the other nurses that it was time for my pain medication so I ended up in excruciating pain until she got back from stuffi,ng her face full of food. Which was almost two hours after I was supposed to have had them. No apologies from her. Then I found out that I was supposed to be getting my pain meds every four hours instead of six like they were annotated in my chart. The day the doctor released me the cleaning ladies came in to clean and told us that since we had been released by the doctor we could wait outside of the room until the nurses gave me my release documents.  We ended up waiting for 30 minutes or so until we decided to go up to the nurses desk and ask what was taking so long. Then finally they said that they had not even started working on my release paperwork. That took about ten minutes. After that they had my husband wheel me out to the car instead of one of the staff doing it. I was very, very disasatisfied with the entire expperience. Choose another hospital and do your research before getting admitted to an experience you will suffer through. If you happen to get a male nurse named Richard he is one of the best and most caring nurses I have ever come across in any hospital.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
