5.0,"Best hospital in Houston. Friendly Staff, nice environment and some of the best doctors. The place is clean and the outpatient building is quite new. Food here is great too.",Houston Methodist Hospital
4.0,"I agree with below poster, the best hospital food there is!  But, points off for being in a hospital.,My only qualm is that the soups are never vegetarian, and I always want soup.  Instead I have to go to the salad bar (boo hoo) or the dessert bar (woo hoo) or the endless lines of grills, sandwiches, stir fries, etc.,Too many ways to ruin your triple bypass...",Houston Methodist Hospital
2.0,"The selling point of this cafe is the variety. It's OK food for relatively cheap, and if you work late in the med center it's a staple of your diet. ,Soups never seem fresh, sushi isn't really fresh, the hamburgers and grill make what you want on the spot. The cornbread is NEVER fresh, but the deserts are usually good,Recommendations: philidelphia cheesesteak. greasy and tasty",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"I was never a patient here, but I came as a New York licensed nurse on an Evidence Based Practice research conference recently and was absolutely amazed.  The facility is gorgeous.  Every single person I met was curtious and professional.  From housekeeping to the top administrators ---everyone made me feel welcome and they were willing to help me find my way around.  Cant wait to come back for another conference...and if I were ever to live in Houston I would definitly apply to work here.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"First off this is a review of the cafe.  This is by far the best hospital food I've had.  Their cafe honestly better than Luby's cafe food.  They offer a wide variety of selections from fresh to order sandwiches, a BBQ area, Asian Stir frys, Homestyle cooking meals, Tex-Mex stand, Pasta Bar, Pizza, Sushi, fresh made salads and soup, and a made to order grill.  But what makes this a 5 star is their desserts.  Their desserts are amazing!  The presentation looks like something out of la madeline.  I am willing to make the walk from work to this cafe.",Houston Methodist Hospital

3.0,At least a 5 hour wait in the ER.... :/,Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
1.0,"WORST ER EVER!!! I was recently directed by my OB to come here after vomiting for 15+ hours. I arrived at 1 am and by 530 am had still never seen a dr. I was put in a room for 2.5 hours and no one ever came to check on me. I was not clinically dehydrated upon arrival but after 4 hours of continuous vomiting in this ER I was severely dehydrated. I was told by the asian nurse that there was only one dr working the ER. WHAT????? After being in the room for so long my husband finally opened the door to the hallway to see what was going on. We could hear woman gossiping and laughing at the desk. He pushed the button to call for a nurse and the lady from admitting came in the room and asked, literally, ""what do you want?"" Why was she coming in? She is not even medical personnel! My husband asked for the nurse, when she finally showed up she was irritated to be there and very cold and curt. I begged for something to stop the vomiting and she coldly informed me that it was against the law for her to give me anything with out orders from the dr. I asked how much longer the dr would be and she responded that there were still several people in front of me that I would just have to ""deal with it."" I finally began crawling to get out of the bed and told her we would be leaving and going to a different hospital to which she responded that I should do what ever I wanted. When I put my shoes on and began walking out the door she began YELLING that she would call the police if I left with the IV port in my arm. (this was put in but never used, why???) I told her to call the police. She RAN out the door to go call the police. She was clearly more concerned about the port than my welfare. My husband convinced me to let her remove it and she beraded me the entire time. I have never experienced such treatment at a medical facility in all my life. When I reached another emergency room, my pulse was 117 and I was severely dehydrated. I required two bags of fluids and the dr was in shock that I was left so long without care. He explained that dehydration is very serious during pregnancy. I informed my OB about my experience and he said he has had 3 other patients complain about the care given here as well as other physicians. His entire practice no longer refers patients to this hospital. I will continue to warn everyone I know about this horrible facility. By the way, 2 years previously my husband came in to the ER in the middle of the day with complaints of chest pain. He had a heart attack one year before this. He sat in the waiting room for 2 hours before they ever checked his cardiac enzymes. We thought this was an isolated incident. Apparently, it is the norm.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
5.0,"I had surgery in feb '11 at this hospital and I give a big thumbs up to the nurses and other staff I dealt with. , I stayed 9 days in the hospital following surgery and although I yearned to be home, the stay was about as pleasant as one could get for a hospital. The rooms are all private and comfortable including a full sized sofa which pulls out to a twin sized bed for overnight stays by family and friends, modern arm chair and side table, flat screen 27"" tv with cable and DVD players, private bathroom, and personalized menu selections for each meal delivered about 20-45 mins after ordering.  The hospital also provides free wifi which was highly utilized during my stay.,My room also had a huge knee to ceiling window with a nice view of 249 which made my room seem more like a hotel suite. , Again the staff and the nurses were very pleasant and such a joy to be around.  They all seemed to enjoy their jobs and aimed to please the patients.  I still remember my nurses names who I enjoyed the most; Shasha, Alyssa, and Mary Ann.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
3.0,"I went to St. John for an outpatient surgical procedure.  I found the registration process to be simple and quick and the nursing staff to be friendly and helpful.  The facility seemed clean and in good repair.  Bright lighting and decor in the lobby and waiting room was a nice change from some other hospitals I have been in.,My procedure went well and recovery was quick.  The friendliness of the nurses in the outpatient surgery unit helped to make me feel comfortable.",Houston Methodist St John Hospital
5.0,Very professional. The MRI department does a great job.,Houston Methodist St John Hospital
1.0,"I was born at TMH in the med center 46 yrs ago and have been a patient there more times than I can count.  So when we moved to Clear Lake I assumed Methodist/St John's would be a good hospital.  ,I was wrong!  I had one of the worst ER experiences today.  No need for details.  Worst male  triage nurse I have ever met in my life.... After being a rude condescending unprofessional and a complete jerk to me in the triage.... he must have found my husbands pain funny because I overheard him laughing about my husband to the doc as the other nurse showed us to our room.,I will say our RN Amanda was fantastic'",Houston Methodist St John Hospital
3.0,"i went to the ER on a wednesday around 8 pm after falling 10 feet while bouldering and injuring my arm. my friend pulled up to the front door to walk me in and an off-duty nurse who was clearly heading home from her shift told us we needed to enter through the ER which was on the opposite side of the hospital. i was in a lot of pain so she offered to wheel me there--a 10/15 min walk. she spoke to me and kept me calm the entire time and was just wonderful. thank you, Laura!,the ER was empty except for 2 others. i went right up to the registrar which was kind of an awkward experience bc she's asking for all this info while i'm crying in pain. plus she asked me what my social security number was and there were other ppl well within hearing distance so that made me uncomfortable to have to recite it out loud. i didnt have my wallet with me though so it was kind of them to admit me immediately despite no insurance card or id.,i ended up waiting over an hour until i got some pain medicine for a broken arm. nurses and X-ray techs came in and out throughout that hour but they kept telling me the meds were coming, the meds were coming. when the shot of morphine didnt help, i had to wait another hour until they gave me an iv drip--the entire hour before, i was telling them i was still in a lot of pain. also the payment collector person came in even before i got either of those medications, so it was just frustrating to be told i needed to pay $500 upfront and i hadn't had any sort of treatment yet/no one had seen me.,overall, the entire ordeal took over 5 hrs, which is to be expected at the ER i guess. i didnt mind being there for 5 hours, i just think timeliness and the order in which things happened could have been better. the staff was fine though, nice in their exchanges and informative. the X-ray techs---mike, levi, and carlos---were very accommodating as i had trouble shifting to the X-ray table so they offered to take the images from my hospital bed.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
5.0,"I'm not writing as a patient, but as a guest I give the place five stars. Every single one of my relative's nurses and attendants has been fantastic. They are friendly and they never rushed the patient. They also treated her with the dignity and respect that she needed when she was in a vulnerable state.,Every employee that I encountered had exactly the right attitude and was sympathetic towards guests and patients. The first person i talked to walked me to where I was going when I asked for directions,  even though that probably wasn't part of his regular duties.,One other thing-- the cafeteria/food court is five stars for variety, food quality and pricing.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"Largest and greatest variety of cuisines I've ever seen in a hospital. Shouldn't be surprised considering TMH's size. ,Great food; try the salmon as it's ALWAYS on point! ,Some of the valet guys, eh hit or miss. Some nice, others in DESPERATE need of some customer service training.",Houston Methodist Hospital
4.0,"I'm fairly familiar with The Methodist Hospital.  My grandmother was a patient in the early 90's, I worked across the street in Scurlock Tower for a few summers in my high school days, and most recently my mom was a patient.,It seems that the hospital is aware that not everyone is there for happy times, like childbirth, and great care is taken to allow people to be at peace.  There are places for people to pray and worship regardless of their religion, and there is a beautiful garden where people can meditate or just be alone.  I was able to stay overnight in my mom's room with her on a pull-out chair that laid flat and wasn't as uncomfortable as I anticipated, and the nurses gave me linens and pillows.  Additionally, the cafeteria has good food and it's not overpriced.  I realize people don't hang out at hospitals for the food, but when you're there for an extended period of time, it's good to know you don't have to venture far away from your ill loved one just to grab a bite to eat.,However, I had two frustrations: the length of time it took to get my mom from recovery to an actual room, and the length of her bed in her room.  Since check-out is at 11am every day, you'd think the empty rooms would be cleaned and prepped by 4:30pm when my mom was technically finished with the recovery phase of her surgery.  Nope - three hours later, she was finally wheeled into a room.  Every time the nurse in the recovery room called to the nurse's station on the patient floor, they said it wasn't ready yet.  Also, my mom is 5'9"" and the bed seemed to be meant for the pediatric unit.  She had to crumple up her legs in order to fit them in the bed, but she wasn't able to turn onto her side to sleep.  Eventually, (five hours after the first request with several other requests in the meantime) she was given a bed extension so she could lay down like normal.,Overall, I think The Methodist Hospital is great, and should I find myself in Houston in need of medical attention, it would be at the top of my list for places to go if I had the choice.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"After spending more than 84 days in this place I think I have a pretty good feel for the place.  The staff here is amazing, everyone from transportation to housekeeping were always so nice to me.  The nurses and doctors were amazing, and they  saved my life.  ,I found the hospital easy to navigate, friendly staff members everywhere and after you do it once or twice parking is really easy.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"This is mostly a review of the cafeteria, but this really IS ""as good as it gets"" for hospital food.  I haven't had a single thing I didn't like.  You really can't go wrong.  Their desserts look fabulous too.  Everyone raves about their bread pudding.  They are busiest from 11-1, but the checkout lines move fast.,On to the hospital...  Fortunately for me, I've never had to be an inpatient at a hospital. *Knock on wood.* But if you have to go to the hospital, you can't go wrong with Methodist.  They are awesome.  I'm a student nurse here, and it beats the other hospital I was at last semester, which shall remained unnamed.  You will encounter the occasional person who probably should not be in that profession, but that happens everywhere.  Don't let that keep you from coming here.",Houston Methodist Hospital
4.0,"Thanks GOD I have never actually had to visit as a patient...not to say that they don't have some of the best doctors in the world working here, because they do. But I have been fortunate enough to enjoy good health. ,I visit Methodist because the GREATEST neurologist works here...and I get the pleasure of picking her up from work every now and then!!!,With that said, Houston is the best place in the world to get sick!!!",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"Came in with my Mom due to her having back pain. Staff has been fantastic, even though I am not the patient My Mom's nurse brought me a warm blanket (fresh from the drier) and everyone has been respectful and kind.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,Methodist hospital is a wonderful hospital..If you have to be in the hospital no place better. The staff and the doctors are the best. It is a beautiful hospital very serene setting in the lobby. They tend to your every need. Very friendly staff on all levels.I wish everyone reading this good health but if you have to go to the hospital you will feel very taken care of here.,Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"Great hospital with a great staff. The MarketPlace Cafe (their cafeteria) is pretty amazing considering it's hospital food. I would by no means come here specifically for food but if you work here, then you don't have it so rough. With a make-your-own-salad bar, a plethora of mini desserts (MY KRYPTONITE), and a pretty good home cooking station, there's something for almost everyone. I also respect that the cafeteria makes brown rice sushi, that there's a Starbucks in the lobby, that it has a Mariott Hotel, and that they have a volunteer who plays the piano beautifully for people in the lobby. It's been on quite a few lists for best oncology, pediatrics, cancer treatments, and many more. ,Overall, a great hospital.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"The staff is very helpful, alert, and happy.  I'm very confident knowing  Methodist Willowbrook is the hospital closest to our home.  Having first hand experience with the ER I'm happy to say we were quickly attended to.  Granted, it was heart issues, but they acted professionally and quickly.  I can't say enough good about this facilty.  The communicaiton between staff is exceptional.  It is a customer service centered facility.,Only negative needing improvement is security at night , it's not that comforting nor visible.  I think there could be more night security both in the parking lot and common areas.    Hopefully security camera's are in place and working.  If you leave the building at night the only way you can get back in the building is via the ER entrance.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
4.0,"The Methodist Hospital Cafeteria is very good! There are lots of options from Asian stir fry (with spring rolls and egg rolls), grill station (burgers and fries), salad bar, pizza, pastries, desserts, and more! It's a wonderful selection for hospital food... but don't be fooled, it is still hospital food!!  ,Today I had some fried rice and it was gross.  It had been soaked too long and the rice was all mushy. The egg rolls are ok. The chicken sandwich was ok and cheap! The fries were not worth getting.,The soda machine was down, so you had to purchase bottled soda or tea.,It's good as far as hospital food goes. It's just not 5 stars compared to food outside of the hospital.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,Beautiful and clean hospital. My sister had all 3 of her kids here and I had mine at the Willowbrook location. Methodist hospital is the best hospital in Houston.,Houston Methodist Hospital
4.0,"Two scary experiences had led me to the Methodist Hospital. ,My 1st was for endoscopic thoracic surgery, where the surgeons work closely on my spine...to me that was nerve-wracking. And actually, the doctors were really working on my nerves, literally. I have hyperhidrosis, an overactive nervous system where my hands, feet, and armpits would excessively sweat. Thanks to the wonderful Dr. Garza and his special team, my hands and armpits are no longer embarrassing me (as for my feet, well that's another story and perhaps another surgery another day)!  To sum it all up in simple terms, the doctor removed the ganglion nerves from my spine between thoracic bones T3 and T4 and replaced the nerves with tubes. And voilà presto!!!....sweat be-gone!,My 2nd experience wasn't so great. I had a really bad and very rare reaction to some medication I was taking, which led me to my 7-day stay at this hospital.  I had to deal with a large team of various doctors: dermatologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, internal medicine, cardiologist, etc. Nobody knew how to deal with me or my symptoms. When I was in the bathroom, I had suddenly turned dark purple all over. My mother panicked and pulled the emergency cord. Nobody came! She pulled it 2 more times and still no attention from staff!!! She ran out to get help. I was soon given morphine and felt really good after that! ;) To make a long story short, I was given special skin cream and strong steroids and the problem went away on its own after months of waiting on the meds to flush out of my system.,The only positive thing from that horrific experience was meeting a great oncologist, Dr. Foote. He's funny, patient, caring, and knowledgeable. The other doctors weren't so patient with me and weren't so friendly to this suffering patient.,The meals served (and even the choices available) each day were actually okay for hospital food.  Also, the cafeteria food was tasty too. My mother kept telling me how much she loved the burgers from the cafeteria and would often get them during her visits.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"Best hospital in Houston.  Will not change it for anything. I live in the east side, and still manage to go to med center Methodist instead of the Methodist in Baytown. Mrs. Debra in the ER is the bomb. I was there 5-28 bymyself and she was so kind and sweet. Even gave me a hug. :) ,My granny has been going to this hospital for almost 40+ years. I have had 3 of my 4 bb's there. Love it. :)",Houston Methodist Hospital
4.0,"Great Hospital, crappy parking....",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"This review will cover the facility, staff, work, experience and the cafeteria.,I've had some of the most memorable and rewarding experiences working at this hospital.  Each and every nurse and surgeon I worked alongside were highly knowledgeable in their focus as well as enthusiastic about their positions there.  One would feel the same way over the great benefits, good coworkers and the hospital's #1 goal for patient and employee satisfaction.,I worked in the operating room for orthopedics, neuro and general cases.  Everyday was a rewarding and educational experience.  The facilities were always clean, sterile and every nurse and surge were attentive to the case at hand.  Every patient left happy.,The building(s) itself is beautiful.  You're welcomed by high cathedral sky-light ceilings, a tranquility fountain, marble floors and a musician at the baby grand piano.  It's very inviting to families waiting or worried about their loved ones being tended to.  Plenty of lounging area.,The cafeteria can't be beat here.  Personally I think it rivals top college cafes like UCLA.  Several stations hone different international cuisines.  Everything is prepared fresh in the many exposed kitchens.  Many of the menu items are made to order as well.  I've never had one bad meal here.  ,The medical staff is the best.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"This is definitely one of my weirder reviews, but hey I'm weird.,First of all the ER is pretty quickly. I was there twice in a span of a week, and both times my time in the waiting room was under 15 min. The intake process involved less paperwork than expected. I was in and out of the hospital in no time.,The nurses were blunt as expected, but they were quite respectful, and didn't treat me like a complete idiot. They were helpful with all my questions. ,The care was good and all but I feel like this review is more about the food. It was kind of an obsession during my stay there. I think it's partially because I'm a college student, and hadn't eaten a decent meal in weeks. Actually it was pretty tasty by any cafeteria type standards. Again, college student eating in an absolutely horrific cafeteria. During my stay they would give you a menu each day with some pretty good choices, but I was pretty sick of jello by the end of it (and I didn't think that was humanly possible!). The actual cafeteria has a great variety and worth eating at if you find yourself in the med center.",Houston Methodist Hospital
5.0,"Heart problems run in my family.  I guess its just the bad heart gene passed down on my father's side.  I have had Atrial Fibrillation (rapid heartbeat) for over 20 years.  I have gone to Cardiologist after Cardiologist from Tyler, Tx. to Texas City, Tx and to no avail could anyone get a handle on slowing my heart rate to a normal sinus rhytum.  I would get a Cardioversion (electrical shot to the heart) and my heart would take a regular rhythum for 2 or 3 days and them BAM, it would go right back into Atrial Fibrillation.  Doctors loved to ""medicate"" me.  I've tried just about every heart rhytum medication known to man.  Then one day while in my Cardiologist's office in Texas City I saw one of his associates, a Doctor Seabolt. ,This is where my life takes a right turn.  Dr. Seabolt told me of an Electrophysiologist (they work on the electrical part of the heart) named Dr. Nadim Nassir.  Dr. N. Nassir is with Willowbrook Cardiovascular Associates and has an office in the Medical Center in the Scurlock Tower.  He operates out of the Methodist Hospital right across the street.  A walkway over Fannin connects the two buildings.  I started seeing Dr. Nadim Nassir and kicked my regular Cardiologist to the curb in Texas City.  I have been seeing this man for under 6 months.  He covered the regular gauntlet changing a few medications and 4 different Cardioversions.  A little over a month ago he changed me over to Amioderone and issued another Cardioversion.   IT WORKED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have now been in regular sinus rhythum for over a month now and I feel so much better.,I cannot reccomend Dr. Nadim Nassir and Methodist Hospital highly enough.  They have literally changed and extended my life for the better.  The professionalism and the expertice that I have been surrounded by at this hospital has been amazing.",Houston Methodist Hospital

5.0,"Labor and Delivery was awesome here at this hospital.  Everyone was fantastic. When I would call for things like help walking somewhere or help turning around the nurses came with a smile and were very sweet. After the baby was born, the delivery nurse came in when her shift was over and gave me a big hug. I felt great with the people there!,The delivery room was spacious and the post pardum room was comfortable. Both rooms were private and although you could hear the babies crying in other recovery rooms it was very faint (I slept through it most of the time).,My husband slept nicely on the pull out couch.  The only thing I would complain about would be the on call pediatrician that is assigned if you don't have one picked out is a little insensitive.

2.0,"We came here for a simple x-ray of my husband's achilles heel area after a visit to our doctor's office in the adjoining professional building. The facility is very nice,  spacious and sparkling new. Lots of great comfortable waiting/seating areas to accomodate patients & visitors. We had no idea how important that would come to be. After being directed to the area where we would get the x-ray & checking in with the clerk, we sat for an unusual amount of time. We watched several people who had checked in AFTER us called back for their x-rays. My husband went to ask why & was told that they were going to be calling him soon. Then after another wait, he again went to see what was the delay (he was clearly agitated at this point). We were then informed that the x-ray order was not correct (it did not specify which foot) and because of that they needed our doctor to fax over a corrected order before they could proceed. Our issue was not the error as mistakes occur, but no explanation was given to us while we just continued to sit and wait & be passed over by people who had checked in after us. At a minimum, WE could have called our doctor's office to expedite the correction it someone had simply told us the reason for the delay. It just caused my husband a lot of irritation as he was already in an incredible amount of pain & was ready to pick up his meds and get home & this was an unreasonable delay.",Houston Methodist West Hospital

The staff other than the ultrasound tech were rude and rough with my wife. We were never given a bed until we were to see the doctor for his explanation. That was four hours in the emergency room.

4.0,"No one likes having to go to the hospital, but if you do this is the one to go to. We had our baby here and had to stay a week due to complications. The nurses were very nice and on hand at all times. They would get me anything I asked and shared their knowledge with us about anything we needed. The lactation consultant was the funniest person ever, so enthusiastic about her job. The hospital did make me stay a day longer due to their mistake, and my husband wasn't that happy about that. We had our own private room the whole time we were their and my husband was able to sleep on the couch, although he did fall off once because the cushion isn't connected and he just slid. We didn't have a view at all, but at least the food was decent. It does take 45 min for them to deliver food to you form the time that you call, but they tell you that on the phone, sometimes it takes longer, so don't call when you are hungry. Although when you are having your baby here they automatically bring you food, so if you forget to call in your order you might just get a chicken breast and pudding and veggies to eat.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital

1.0,"The sad thing about this place is it is the only hospital in the Katy area that has a Cath lab so if the 911 ambulance thinks you are having a Heart attack or you think you are having a heart attack and are driven to Methodist West Houston...Patient beware.  What I was told after the fact is there are NO Staff Cardiologists there.  They call in a doctor who works out of that hospital and several other hospitals in the area and they come from all over when they are called.  I wanted to get to the Med Center..I knew I was having the Big One.  Being a female...I had to convince them and beg them to take another EKG.  This is when they called CODE BLUE!  I asked again to be transferred with Oxygen to the med center and that is only a 15 minute drive in an ambulance, blaring....This did not happen.  I had some doctor that I could not pronounce his name and he  said I would die in 20 minutes.  I prayed for my life.  I woke up and my husband was with me as was my son.  They told me that the doctor said I had a huge clot in the LAD but no heart damage.  He stented it and I would be fine.  I was not fine and knew it.  This doctor like the other cardiologist, I was told, is not an exclusively  Methodist Cardio.  He makes the rounds of several hospitals.    I still had discomfort but figured it was the stent in the LAD.  Less than 3 weeks later the pains escalated at 3:00AM in the morning.  I was NOT going back to Methodist West Houston to get just anybody, again.  I wanted the Mercedes so my husband flew down the WestPark tollway from Cinco Ranch and made it to the Medical Center ER in 24 minutes.  Thank God there was no traffic at that time.  ER was waiting for me.  I was treated like a queen.  I awoke with two Interventionalist Cardiologists at my side.  They had to put in another stent ..larger than the one that the other doctor at Methodist West Houston had put in.  His was apparently too small causing problems. .  I am now in heart failure with heart damage.  Had things been done differently the first time, 3 weeks earlier at Methodist West, we feel I would not of suffered a second massive heart attack, 3 weeks later.  ,Isn't it a shame that Katy is growing by leaps and bounds and many Seniors are moving here to be closer to their  children and grandchildren.  With Senior Populous we bring medical problems and are more prone to serious health woes. Builders are building more patio Homes for us...Senior Apartments are being built....Even Luby's is getting into the act as they know where the Seniors are and that Seniors love Luby's.....Thank You, Luby's.......But, Methodist West Houston needs their Own Physicians that work out of that hospital exclusively and know the Cath Lab inside and Out.....and chose the right size stent for a patient.  I am truly sorry we moved here for this very reason.  I am scared. And, no Provider  should tell a patient  they have only 20 minutes to live.  Gads.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"Ok, my dad was admitted to this hospital late Monday night. I came to visit at 9 am the next morning. He was admitted for muscle spasms and overall pain in his shoulders and back. He has a history of this. He also has a bad heart. The stress from the pain caused his heart to have problems. They needed to control the pain to be able to work on the heart. From 9am-1 pm I was there with him. They decided to put him on a pain pump. That took 4 hours to hook up. He has now been there one whole day since then. His pain has gotten worse. They haven't come up with a plan of action to help him. The pain Dr. Has been less than friendly or helpful. He was also disrespectful to a nurse in front of my mom and dad. It was very unprofessional. I just called my mom to see how he is doing. She was crying and he was screaming. I wouldn't be writing this if I felt they had done everything. From what I have observed and heard, they have not done a damn thing!!!!  Do not go up there if you have a choice. They are useless!!!",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"This Methodist location (Katy) is horrible & crooked. Their scheduling department is a joke & I had the most frustrating experience with them & the scheduler I got (Rashawnda) was extremely rude & was just a miserable person. I've never been treated like that. When I arrived their registration department was a mess. I waited over two hours, no one knew what they were doing, & when I went to ask what was going on & why I was still waiting I was told ""Sorry, you came at lunch, everyone is on break, there isn't much I can do about that. Just have a seat & we will get to you when we can get to you"". I was in shock & wanted to walk out but I needed the test done & had already taken off of work. After 2 hours I was registered & was told I owed more money than I should have paid. I tried pointing this out to them, but they had no idea what they were doing so I ended up just paying what they said. I later spoke with my insurance company who also agreed I over paid & they helped me get my money back, but, it took about 7 weeks for the hospital to do this. This is unacceptable & most people don't have money to give away because the registration department has no clue what they are doing & can't even read an insurance card. I finally made it to the radiology department & was further shocked. The lady at their check in desk was wrapped up in a blanket! Can you imagine? She was unprofessionally in appearance & behavior. She was gossiping with another employee when I walked up & you could tell from body language she was upset & she handed me a clip board without even turning to face me! She was still gripping to her co-worker. This is supposed to be Methodist mind you! I've never been treated like this. This is an open area & she was talking bad about other radiology technicians not doing their job & how their manager wouldn't fix it. Patients should NEVER hear things like this. I filled out the paperwork & gave it back to her & then waited over 45 minutes for my cat scan. The CT technician that came to get me was nice, but the only word that comes to mind that describes my experience with her is incompetent. Her personal appearance was horrible, her scrubs were dirty, wrinkled, & too large. She looked dirty & had greasy hair, & I, sorry to say she had a horrible order to her  both from her body & her mouth. When someone is poking on you & using needles on you, you want your surroundings & the people taking care of you to be clean. She tried 3 times to start an IV on me & couldn't get it. She was shaking & you could tell she had no idea what she was doing. She took the needle out at know point & I had blood leaking everywhere & she froze! I held a tissue to it! She finally got someone else to help her & they got it first try. This technician apologized for the other one & seemed frustrated with her. I'm assuming from her body language that this happens all the time. The cat scan room was dirty too. There was a sticky mess all over the floor & the machine & I stepped in it & told the technician but she just threw a towel over it! This is unacceptable! My experience at Methodist Hospital's West location was miserable & I will never go there again & I will tell my family & friends not to go there either. This hospital is clearly not an extension of the original Methodist Hospital in the medical center. As another review said I would rather drive to downtown Houston & pay to park then ever come here again. The kicker is I asked to speak to the radiology manager & when she finally came to talk to me she was rude & short with me as well. She clearly had no interest in talking to me & it seemed she was in a hurry. I asked if she could do anything & she said at this hospital they had no ""service recovery"", whatever that is, so her hands were tied.  Now, I'm not an expert in these things, but if you hear abad story of how a patient was treated & don't care to make it better,then you clearly don't belong in healthcare. So disappointed in Methodist West Houston Hospital!",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"On the morning of February 27th I went to the Methodist Hospital ER in Katy.  I was not impressed with the service for several reasons.,1.  The triage nurse, although friendly, made jokes that, when one is at the ER and having a difficult time, both my husband and I considered inappropriate.  Calling to ask for a room for the night for me as a joke while I am silently freaking out is not helpful.,2.  The doctor, also friendly, was also a little too jokey about my health problem and situation.  I used to work in an ER and Trauma Center, so I understand the humor.  However, I think it is important that staff remember that no one goes to the ER on a Sunday morning (or ever??) for a good time.  Just do your job, do it well and get it done.  Leave the humor at the door.,and finally, 3.  After spending my co-pay of $130, it was found by my doctor at follow up that the ER did not even give me the necessary treatment needed.  Due to the lack of treatment, which was time sensetive, I may face additional health problems in the future.  ,Thanks, guys.,Now that Katy has multiple choices for hospital care, choosing an ER (or healthcare of any kind, for that matter) isn't just a shot in the dark anymore.. you can choose someone you really like and trust.  After my experience on Sunday, I will not be going to Methodist again and I will encourage others to do the same.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,My wife was transfered there today after being at freestanding ER all day. The Er doctor at Spheir Er Called over and explained everything to the admissions department.  She was a direct Admit into Methodist.   My wife 6 months ago had a shunt put in for Pseduotumor and was having issues with it. She started to have severe headaches and vomiting 2 days ago.   We really did not want to go to Methodist because of our last visit there 2 years ago but were assured by the ER doctor at Spheir that everything was going to be OK because he had went into detail and was sending the new CT scans and x-rays.  Stated that her valve needed to be adjusted because it was draining too much.  So that brings us back to  2 years ago when she was there suffering from severe headaches and vomiting and we went to Methodist.  The attending physician accused my wife of seeking drugs and discharged her even though she was still in severe pain.  The following week we were back at another hospital Christis.  It was there where the ER doctor asked for her ct scan from Methodist West and asked us If they had talked to us about possible MS.  So he then tested her for it and measured her spinal fluid pressure and it was over 40.  So then she was reffered to a neurologist who treated her with meds to decrease fluid and that did not work.  Her eye vision then went bad and she was sent to a neurosurgeon and had a shunt put in immediately.  Well any way she started having problems with the shunt not working correctely yesterday and we went to a free standing ER and was then transfered back to this hospital.  The same attending physician saw her and immediately accused her of seeking pain medication.  I informed him that because of him even though he had nothing to do with this we found out what was wrong with her.  (he ordered the CAT scan but ignored the radiologist's recommendations)  Well anyway he then had her transfered to another hospital because he did not want to deal with her.  I will never go back to this hospital or any hospital that Dr. Tampoe is associated with.  I am in medicine and would never accuse someone of something without knowing all the facts.  Never have I seen my wife treated so poorly.  Never will I go to or ever suggest anyone to go to this hospital.  Methodist should be ashamed that this physician represents them.,Houston Methodist West Hospital

I should also mention that I live in North Houston like the Willowbrook area and while there is a Methodist in the Willowbrook area I CHOOSE to drive to the medical center to be seen or I will go to the Emergency Care Center at Kirby.

All the nurses and doctors were competent and friendly and tried their best to make me feel at ease pre-surgery, which was fantastic. My doctor, Dr. Nguyen, explained the procedure of my appendectomy very thoroughly and clearly and my nurse Heather was so nice and understanding throughout the entire ordeal.,The facilities at this hospital are also top-notch. My room had a fantastic view and everything inside seemed very new and up to date. ,They took my health insurance, Aetna, without any issues. My appendectomy came out to a very reasonable price after my insurance paid for most of it. Thanks for saving my life without driving me into bankruptcy Houston Methodist West!!

1.0,"I went to this ER after passing out several times at work. The only thing that got me back to a room in a timely manner (in my opinion) is that I happened to pass out while they were doing an EKG in the triage room. ,I warned the tech who was with me that I felt nauseous and might pass out again, and she hurried looking for a bag instead of making sure I was safe. I pointed out the emesis bags on the wall and in a rude tone she said she knew those were there but wanted something else for me. That's the last thing I remember.,As I came to, someone was shouting that I was having focal seizures (what?! No history of seizures for me or my family) and to get me into a room ASAP. They slapped oxygen on me without a pulse ox and wheeled me to a room where a nurse told me to change into a gown. I took the oxygen off so I could change and forgot to put it back on. The nurse came back in and checked my blood pressure but didn't check my oxygen saturation. He didn't say anything about seizure activity and I was crying, thinking that I had some new neurological disorder so I wasn't thinking clearly enough to ask apporpriate questions. He told me a doctor would be in soon.,We waited about an hour and the nurse came back in asking if a doctor has been in yet. I said no and he said he would be right back. A nurse practitioner (or maybe PA?) came in and looked at my labs, asked me my symptoms, I told her I was taking a beta-blocker and she wrote that down. She started walking out saying my labs looked great but I was probably dehydrated. How does that add up?,The nurse was nice enough but when he came to attach fluids to my IV he had (what looked like) dried blood on his hands. I'm not sure if he washed his hands before entering the room, but he definitely didn't put gloves on when touching my IV which is my preference when I care for patients.,An IV bolus and a couple hours later I was discharged with instructions regarding dehydration. How could I be dehydrated when my chemistry panel and urinalysis came back normal? I went to see my PCP the next day and he said stop taking the beta-blocker immediately, that's what's making me pass out. Easy enough fix. Told me to rest for  a few days without work and I should be OK. Luckily I didn't take my beta-blocker that morning because I assumed that's what the problem was. If I had kept taking it I would've ended up back in the ER. Thanks for incorrectly diagnosing me, Methodist ER. Twice.,I will never return to this ER. ,On a positive note, the outpatient experience I've had so far has been great with the providers (not so much their ancillary staff). When I had an ultrasound done the ultrasonagrapher was friendly and proficient. I love my PCP Dr. Medrano and will continue to see him. However, since my ER experience was so bad I can't give any more stars on my yelp review. I filled out a survey they sent to me about a month ago and put my name and phone number requesting a call. No one every called me. ,Please don't go to this ER if your life is in danger, I'd be scared for you.",Houston Methodist West Hospital

4.0,"We delivered our baby here by unexpected C-section.  Came in on a thursday to induce, delivered on a early Saturday morning and left on a Tuesday.  We had private rooms throughout our stay with an extra bed, the post delivery room was more comfortable than the labor and delivery room.,We had wonderful nurses and doctors in Labor and Delivery and in post delivery care.  Sometimes I wished that they would let us sleep instead of coming into our rooms at 2am to get our blood pressure and temperature.  I don't think I ever got very much sleep while there except while on IV pain meds.  My delivering doctor came in everyday to check up on us.  Nurses were kind and attentive.  ,Breastfeeding isn't always intuitive to mom or baby. They had 3 lactation consultants on staff at the hospital and they were super patient and passionate about the work they do there.  They came in everyday to check in on us too and spent a lot of time with us working on our latch and came up with inventive solutions to help try to feed our baby.  I am super grateful.  ,Tip:  You can rent a Medela Symphony breast pump from the gift shop downstairs for a 2 weeks minimum for around $35.  Totally worth it until you get your breast pump or latch to be consistent. ,Food - I was surprised at the range of food available to order.  They had quite the variety, a 3 page menu for non solid diet and then a 4 page menu when solid food was allowed.  Order about 30-60 minutes ahead and they deliver like room service.  I was usually busy feeding or sleeping so I never got to eat the meals while they were hot.  So that's not their fault.  3 square meals a day and then they had a nutrition room where you could go get snacks, juices and coffee.,I left after my 3rd day, wishing I could stay longer, knowing I wouldn't be able to rest as much as I did in the hospital.  The billing department made me feel uncomfortable on my second day there.  Someone from their billing department asked for my credit card number to charge $901 for my stay.  I thought that was odd and unusual but at the moment I felt I was uneasy also not paying.  Kind of like someone giving you the bill at a restaurant.  How do you not pay?  After giving her my CC number over the phone, I thought the amount she asked for was bogus as I spoke to insurance and Willowbrook hospital before admission and they only quoted my stay to be for  1/2 of that amount.  I panicked and wondered if I had given my CC number to a con.  It turned out it was the hospital and now my insurance company is working on getting the amount corrected.  ,Tip:  Have your insurance company talk to billing instead of handing over your CC number like I did.,Besides being shaken down by their billing department.  I had a good experience,  I felt the staffed was thoughtful and attentive to us and our family.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital

3.0,"I had to take my mom to the ER several times in the span of August-October of Last year for varies reason. I have encountered some questionable situations about their ER section. It seems like the staff who work the front desk could careless about your entrance. I can't say this is everybody, but it was the ones I was there those months. Of course, my mom went through some things that needed immediate attention. I am Very disappointed with the front desk staff. There have been several occasions where I took my mom in and NOBODY even acknowledge that we are waiting right in front of them. In fact, there was a manager at a computer desk doing some paperwork, not even caring for people walking up to her. She doesn't even look up. Seriously, if you're going to sit at a computer, let alone at the ER section of the hospital at least show some concern for your patients. I witnessed some people in great pain and they said their wait had been all day! Front desk knew about it, but didn't offer anything to comfort them. Unfortunately, they take patients based on severity, even if you arrived hours before a person with the greatest need. Which I can understand, but how can you measure that equally in all situations?!? Anyhow, once you get passed the ER desk to the back there are extremely caring physicians.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
4.0,"This was the place that I spent most of my nights and weekends at for this year. I was here for 13 weeks straight because my grandmother got sick. She came in with pneumonia and came out with a pacemaker and kidney dialysis.  In the first part, we went to the ER. The ER doctors were finally helpful. They seemed nice and attentive. We had gotten Dr. Caspers again. He recognized my grandmother from years ago and spent the whole entire day in the ER waiting for a bed on the 5th floor. The nurses on the 5th floor are hit and misses. I understand that most nurses on the floor have 4 or 6 patients that they have to tend to but I don't think elderly patients get any love especially the ones that don't speak well or understand English for example my grandmother. Plus, I remembered there were other patients in the other room that the nurses had to yell at or one patient kept hitting the call button to get help but no one came to help.,Among all of the my grandma's nurses and doctors (trust me, she had so many during the morning and night shifts) I had to file a compliant against one of the nurses because she was rude and racist. I just felt that she is in better hands with the nurses and doctors. Plus, that is what nurses in the hospitals are supposed to do which is take care of their patients right? But us being there was to give my granny comfort and letting her know that we are there for her but it was putting a strand on my marriage since my husband would take care of my grandma in the day time, I would go after work until late or even sleep at the hospital. So, I had asked her nurse to take care of my granny because I just need a day to relax in my house on a Saturday since I haven't been home in months. She had the audacity to say, ""Ugh, how am I going to talk to her even though she (my granny) can't understand me"" I told her nicely that my granny can understand you and she can speak. It may be broken English but she can speak. I found that very rude because this hospitals have translators that the nurse could have called plus, I told the nurse that I don't live that far and she can always call me since my number is plastered on the walls.,Oh! Also!!! With non-speaking patients, please beware of some of the nurses that will try to get some kind of pills that aren't supposed to be in their system to knock them out. That has happened to us twice when I demanded to speak to the charge nurse and figured out why my granny received the meds. I saw it in front of me with my eyes when I specifically told a nurse not to give it to my granny and she went behind my back and did it. So, if you are able to spend time with your love ones every day, I recommend you that you should ask the nurses what kind of pills is your love one taking and remember it. Because the patients with no voice (can't speak English) can't talk for themselves.,Besides that few nurses we've had encountered, we spent many times in the ICU and NICU on the 3rd floor, the regular rooms on the 5th floor and 7th floor. I have to admit that the nurses on ICU and NICU are so awesome! They saved my family. The nurses kept telling us that we didn't need to go there and they will take care of my granny. My mother and I was able to get few great nights of sleep. There are also a few of the nurses on the 5th floor and 7th floor that are great as well.  If I could, I would name all of the nurses on here and the personal assistants.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital

They had Really good bedside manners, very attentive to your needs and really fit right on in with the family. However, one of the cardiologists, Dr. Vivek were VERY rude. Actually, he was quite the opposite of what the nurses were. He was condescending, unprofessional and lacked any bedside manners. He blew off the nurses and our request to meet with him about my mom's specific situation, and his attitude was as if we were not supposed to ask questions. ,Overall, this hospital seems like a good place to be when you're ill. It's scenic with their garden and humanless playing piano in the front to welcome you. There are many quiet areas to wait in, and the parking is free!

She just looked at me and said ""oh"" I then mentioned my throat has been severely sore for a week, the nurse looked in my throat and told me she didn't see any puss so she didn't take a swab to test for strep. Sure enough that night while I'm sleeping I'm struggling to pass air through my airway. I go to my trusted Methodist in Katy and immediately they took at swab for strep and was very confused why the hospital yesterday didn't run a test. My tonsils were swollen, my uvula was swollen, and my lymph nodes were swollen. I felt like all of this could've been avoided if the nurse wasn't being lazy at Sugarland.

We truly appreciate what you all have done for my father and his stay at Methodist.,Given that it's a hospital and certain things (such as medications) that was needed wasn't readily available so it extended his stay time, however, they were apologetic and made sure my father was as comfortable as possible.,On the last night of his stay he had a nurse by the name of Nanaya M. and she was very detailed with his medications explaining what its purpose and helped us understand his condition. She was always smiling and sparkling conversations which to me makes everyone that was on edge feeling a little at ease.

1.0,"The emergency room here at this hospital is a joke.,I was having a miscarriage and came to the ER on a weekday. ,The front office staff were so busy arguing about what to eat for lunch, that they hardly paid any attention to the physical and mental state I was in. ,Once I was admitted into a room, the phlebotomist came by to draw my blood, and she was completely rude and inconsiderate. ,My veins are small, so she had a bit of a struggle. Once she stuck the needle in, she began to dig so deeply into my arm that I even began to cry. She obviously didn't care, and continued to dig it deeper, to where she just gave up, took the needle out and inserted it into a different area on my arm. ,Once the blood was flowing in, she began to squeeze my upper arm and I don't even know what happened, but blood squirted all over the floor, bed and my gown. She didn't even bother to clean me up at all or apologize and left.,I literally looked like I murdered someone.,I was sent in for an ultrasound and once I was admitted back, I was left alone for HOURS.,No one came to check on me or ask how I was doing. ,About 4 hours later, a nurse came in and said I was getting discharged?! Wtfreak? She said my HCG levels were still doubling from the last time I saw my obgyn (she spoke with my obgyn earlier ""supposedly"") and said I can leave. ,I left with dried blood all over my arm and in excruciating pain. I ended up miscarrying the baby that evening. ,I've heard good things about their labor and delivery, but their ER is trash. Worst experience ever. ,Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
5.0,"We delivered our son here a few weeks ago and I want to say that this is a WORLD CLASS birthing center.  The care was impeccable, I felt like I was at a hotel, not a hospital.  I delivered our first son here in 2012 and it was good then, but now I can tell the improvements made are great.,They strongly encourage breastfeeding, they listen, they continually care about managing pain and needs.  I remember one night I was bawling at 2 am because I was struggling to nurse when the nurse came to check in on me, she brought me cookies and ice cream and then helped me get my son to latch; that's above and beyond in my book.,We are blessed to have such a center of excellence in birthing in the Katy Community.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
5.0,"This is an awesome ER and Hospital, fast registration and provider was in the room really quick.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
4.0,"Took my dad to the ER three times over the last 10 days. The wait times were 15 minutes, 1 minute and 4 minutes respectively. Registration was fast. The only negative about registration is that the information keyed in at the front desk is pretty much ignored by the nursing staff. They ask for everything again. History. Meds. Pain level. Current symptoms. One nurse said the computer systems were not tied together.,The nursing staff was for the most part very professional. There were two exceptions. But there always are. ,We were admitted on one occasion through the ER and that was quick and painless. No additional paperwork. There was a lack of communication with the surgeon, who was supposed to meet with us and explain the options. That didn't happen until moments before the surgery the next morning. ,This is my dad's go to hospital and for good reason.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
5.0,Excellent facility. It looks very luxurious.  I actually call it the Bentley of hospitals here in Houston.  The staff was very attentive when my mother came in from a car accident. She was seen rather quickly and the staff was very professional and detailed. I'm very happy with the clean and safe practices that were used.,Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"There is only FOUR people in the waoting room. Tons of people have left and yet NOT 1 person from the waiting has ben called. Its a freaking graveyard. ,Rude staff, they are far from patient oriented. They could care less. No bed side manners. Asking questions gets you a snide remark or scuff of the mouth.  ME: how much longer?   (first time ASKING in 3 1/2 hours with a vomiting feverish kid, temp of 102).  Her: (Not checking the computer) You are after a few people... ME: I have been here longer than the 3 of them. HER: Oh well I guess your next. ,Take your family ANY where else. People have been leaving in scores because of the wait. Others like myself have been waiting it out to no avail. I will NEVER come here again. Awful service. ,Wait for them to care & it will no longer be an emergency....",Houston Methodist West Hospital
4.0,Took my best friend here when she was down visiting. They were very prompt and nice. It was my best friends birthday and they gathered up a lot of nurse's and surprised us by singing to her. Then they followed up a few days later to check on her.,Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"I will not use this hospital system again!,Started great in the ER and then downhill for days. Miss communication from admission to discharge. The staff were confused and lack processes for tracking patients.  They did not keep me or my family members updated as to what was going on. The credentialing body was in the building and they seemed more interested in them than taking care of patients. Then the business financial counselors were incompetent and deceptive.  Gave the wrong deductible and presented their charges without taking into account the negotiated insurance rates that are much much lower.  The nursing staff needs upgrade as I saw multiple incidents of infectious control failures.  Also I had to tell the nurses my medication was due, when equipment alarms were going off z(for hours at times),  and remind them to change my dressing several times.  What a mess! I was told that the staff was supposed to check on you every hour, only the night shift did that, waking you up. The day shift were ghosts.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"went to the ER last night 11.01.2012 and it was by far the WORST experience I have had.,First and foremost I have a very serious Auto Immune disease called Addison's Disease. It is a life threatening disease and I am STEROID dependent because my body does NOT produce it.,It was a busy night I understand but I waited in the waiting area for 2 1/2 hours while I vomited the ENTIRE time. (When vomiting I have to have an IV and steroid IV or I WILL have an Addisonian Crisis and CAN DIE. ,After I was called into the room I started puking up blood. After I filled up my second bag of blood and was have EXTREME pain the Doctor casually walked in threw the bag away and said, ""Do you realize we have more bags you need to throw this away"" OMG! REALLY! I said, "" Yes I have filled several of these up and I thought you would want to see that I was vomiting blood"" He BLEW me OFF again!,Doc left the room and I waited for another hour NO IV no STEROID NO NADDA!,Finally I started having crisis symptoms I got really upset and told the nurse in the Doctor that I NEEDED my STEROIDS and Medication!!! It took 5 HOURS after all of this and FINALLY they casually gave me treatment. :/   ,I went for an ultra sound. And about 45 min later the Pain came back and I asked them for something else....20 min later Nurse came back in and said well you are allergic to morphine so I CANT give you anything.. and your test game back normal you gallbladder is fine you can go home!!!!,REALLY what if it was something else.....Im still sick and now have a nice hospital bill on the way!!!  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE.....",Houston Methodist West Hospital
5.0,"Great hospital.  My son and I have both had procedures done here for different reasons and it has always been great for us.  They are very thorough with information leading up to the surgeries, etc.  They value you as a person, no matter how old you are, and they are always looking out for your best! I wouldn't go anywhere else.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"No stars. Very low staff. My 86 year old mother went in for a femur fracture and came out with a stage 3 sacral decubitus ulcer. No communication to the family about this. Discovered this the night of her return home. REALLY!!  Diapers were not changed, no repositioning, and now dealing with this ulcer. I hope the upper management are all pain free and feeling good about their jobs, because you have made my mother now go through some difficult times and healing. This could have been totally avoided. ,Her Daughter, RN",Houston Methodist West Hospital
1.0,"My daughter and I were involved in a car accident and went to the ER at Houston Methodist West Hospital. The staff at the front was very unconcerned, inattentive and distracted by their own personal conversations. When we were finally seen, they attempted to put myself and my daughter, a minor, and still shaken up from the accident, in separate rooms; only after complaining did they decide that it was ok to keep us together. The nurse practitioner who saw us however, was friendly and helpful, along with the radiologists. After being seen we were advised to call back to schedule a follow up appointment (at the same hospital) in 2-3 days, and they gave us the necessary paperwork to support this statement. Within the timeframe (2nd day) I called and left a message requesting a call back; no call back. I called again the next day and spoke to Kim, the person who answered the phone. I explained the reason for my call and tried to schedule a follow up appointment; first she told me that I couldn't be seen for a week, then after placing me on hold, she came back only to tell me that they don't do follow ups and that if I was having chest pain (something that they knew of on the first day I arrived in the ER), I would need to go somewhere else because they don't handle that there. I indicated that I was following the instructions that were given to me from Houston Methodist West Hospital; Kim advised that I follow up with my general practitioner... ,This hospital was extremely unhelpful, discourteous and did all they could to make a bad situation worse. If you want efficient, kind, professional and attentive care, think twice before being persuaded by the new and shiny outward appearance of Houston Methodist West Hospital, you will NOT find it there.",Houston Methodist West Hospital
5.0,"This hospital was very fancy their was a fireplace still picture on the flat screen when i entered my room which put me at ease.All the nurses were very nice and professional.The doctors were very attentive and precise.The housekeepers kept my room clean and upon my request after a 3 day stay i got my sheets changed.yay,I love cleanliness.I was one of those patients that had air fresheners in my room,plants and not to mention i even washed my hair and prepared it for my vistors to come on an everyday basis.My nurses were complimenting me saying my room was the freshest smelling room ever.Maybe thats why they gave me popsicles and treats!!!",Houston Methodist West Hospital
5.0,"I have to admit the first time I came here was for surgery and the instructions they gave were very confusing. After all that though, it's the best hospital I've been to.",Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital
5.0,"I just returned from having outpatient testing and lab work at this hospital.  Yes, I can be a,grump at times when warranted. Well, from the time I signed in at the front desk , I only waited 5 minutes to be talking with schedulers and insurance personnel.  This lady was awesome as my papers were a mess.  (not my fault)  lol   I am backing up a bit as I did make a call an hour before I got to the hospital this morning.  Dear DEAR Connie in your scheduling dept helped me immensely with Tests names and to make sure ICD codes were correct as I literally hate dealing with MEDICARE as you must have all your EYES dotted and TEES crossed or you will be in deep doo doo. ,I am a double STEMI patient and in heart failure. I need hugs and sure got them today with every single staff member who walked my walk with me.  Thank You Methodist Sugar Land. I shall return.  xoxo",Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
5.0,"Mom had a colonoscopy done here.  It was a day surgery.  Things ran pretty smoothly and the staff was all pretty nice.  We checked in, filled out some paper work and then got called to get some billing information.  After that, we were called into the ""pods"" - they are basically your patient rooms but smaller b'c you're only there for a little while.,It's a little annoying that all the preparation takes longer than the procedure itself!!  But I guess that's just how things are.  But like I mentioned before, it all ran as smoothly as things like this can go and it was as pleasant as an experience like this can be.",Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
3.0,"2 parts for this review.,1)Unexpected hidden gem:,Great study spot. Open 24 Hrs. ,Free Wifi. Free coffee, free water. ,2nd floor day surgery lobby area is quiet as a mouse.,2) pretty bad experience for my dad as a patient here. definitely not going to recommend being a patient here.",Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
1.0,My Mom was released from Methodist Sugar Land Hospital even though she could barely stand or walk and she is still very sick and weak. Methodist Hospital in Sugar Land couldn't get rid of her fast enough for them even though she has insurance and will self pay what insurance doesn't cover. Doctor there was a horrible reflection on the medical profession. Doctor who insisted on discharge did not even bother to come see her physically on day of discharge to know her condition. She phoned it in. But they do have a big beautiful statue of Jesus reaching out to a sick person as you walk in the lobby.,Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
5.0,The staff in Labor and Delivery are amazing. We cannot imagine having are kids any place else.,Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
5.0,"I've gone to this hospital for my colonoscopy.  The check in was fairly quick and easy.  They got me in on time which is the best part.  All the nursing staff was nice as well.  My wife gets her procedures (colonoscopy/mammograms) done her as well and has the same results.  Hopefully, I won't ever have to comment on their emergency room procedures. ;)  My neighbor uses another hospital in Sugar Land (insurance reasons).  Bad results from them.",Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
4.0,"I spent a week here in November 2013. I had the flu, H1N1, that progressed to pneumonia. I thought the doctors and nurses were top notch, very thorough and caring of the patients. I'd recommend this hospital to anyone. The only reason I didn't give this hospital 5 stars is that the food is really, really mediocre. They need to get one of those chefs who knows how to brighten up institutional food so it doesn't all taste like cardboard. But, since that's not the most important thing, I highly recommend this hospital.",Methodist Sugar Land Hospital
